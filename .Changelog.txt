[b]Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Lots of compatibility changes for the PvP update (NPC gear, transition levels...)
[*] Takeover changes: mostly some code cleanup, hopefully no bugs
[*] You need -30 reputation with the opposite faction to start the takeover questline. 
[*] Split the takeover military radio into 2, so you need to get a new radio from the military officer in outposts.
[*] Habitation-type outposts increase the chance of upgrading nearby outposts more consistently
[*] No more Lair in cold caverns (this caused problems)
[*] Added new husks to husk lairs
[*] Some outpost commonness adjustments (less construction in early biomes)
[*] Industrial incident is slightly easier to complete (I wont spoil)
[/List]
