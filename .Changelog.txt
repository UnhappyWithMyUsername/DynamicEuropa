[b]New:[/b]

[List]
[*] New Wet Cargo mission
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Increased the amount of outposts appearing in Great Sea and Hydrothermal wastes. The lack of outposts was locking players out of buying and upgrading submarines to proceed to the end due to the hull upgrade requirements. 
[*] Reduced the probability of hunting grounds destroying outposts. Before all outposts adjacent to hunting grounds would have a 100% chance of getting destroyed. Now the smallest outposts have a 50% chance of being destroyed per turn, and a smaller % for the largeer outposts. This allows players to actually rescue outposts before they get destroyed.
[*] Outposts destroyed by hunting grounds turn into destroyed stations
[*] Pirate outposts turn into destroyed stations after clearing them
[*] Finally done with outpost decorations (or am I)
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 

[List]
[*] Fixed Hunting grounds destroying stations with a proxmity of 2 instead of just adjacent stations
[*] Fixed broken unrepairable Bertha pirate sub
[*] Some pirate sub fixes
[*] Some outpost waypoint fixes
