[*] List
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Changes to biomes: less icebergs/spires, greatseabasic large and open with wide abyss islands, greatseanarrow is less zigzagey, greatseavertical added from vanilla, plateaubasic abyss is very shallow, reduced ruin spawn chance for performance
[*] Removed "Underattack" location from generating. This makes some locations transform into others much faster
[*] Station takeover adjustments: You now lose -200 reputation when attacking a station. This puts you in a state of war against the defending faction. After killing enough enemy soldiers, the station turns to your faction. "Neutral" NPCs like shops and doctor are now present in the stations and will flip to your side after clearing the mission. Reduced the amount of enemy soldiers.
[*] Start with higher clown and bandit reputation in campaign
[*] Keep some of the slime samples from the mission
[*] Blockades now have a cozy little shop room.
[*] Coalition cargo crew now reacts to stealing crates
[*] Removed U43 Coalition submarine from spawning in coalition cargo mission (very unbalanced and performance heavy). More balanced subs may get introduced as a replacement later.
[/List]
