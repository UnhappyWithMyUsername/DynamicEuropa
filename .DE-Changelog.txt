[b]New:[/b]

[List]
[*] Nothing :(
[/List]

[b]Changes:[/b]

[List]
[*] Disabled some of the bigger pirate ships due to perfromance concerns. More smaller pirate ships might get added in the future
[*] Reduced enemy submarine NPC crews sizes from a maximum of 15 to 10
[*] Change ruin probability from 50% to 20% to improve performance. Ruin missions still guarantee a ruin will spawn
[*] Made world map a little more readable
[*] Reduce chances of spawning beacons on world map slightly, as more custom beacon missions were added
[*] Improved piezo crystal performance and VFX
[/List]

[b]Fixes:[/b] 

[List]
[*] Fix Geode rocks being half-stuck in terrain and being hard to mine
[*] Fix Separatists giving the wrong takeover mission
[/List]

List of important TODOs:

- DLC COMPATIBILITY
- Make sure NPCPrefabs are up to date with vanilla
- A proper starting outpost for the campaign, currently WIP but not as good as it should
- Get rid of the lair docking hatch thing, it's not supposed to exist
- Job board rework, gives small side tasks for low rewards (requires overhaul of https://github.com/FakeFishGames/Barotrauma/discussions/16160)
- Give separatists their own subs to differentiate them from pirate subs (defined in missions). It can just be a recolored coalition sub with a logo (causes problems with mod compatibility)
- Change the wall health on submarines back to normal when devs add hull upgrades for pirates
- More station modules for variety
