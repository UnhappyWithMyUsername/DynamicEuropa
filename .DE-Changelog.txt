List of important TODOs:

- DLC COMPATIBILITY
- Make sure NPCPrefabs are up to date with vanilla
- A proper starting outpost for the campaign, currently WIP but not as good as it should
- Get rid of the lair docking hatch thing, it's not supposed to exist
- Job board rework, gives small side tasks for low rewards (requires overhaul of https://github.com/FakeFishGames/Barotrauma/discussions/16160)
- Give separatists their own subs to differentiate them from pirate subs (defined in missions). It can just be a recolored coalition sub with a logo (causes problems with mod compatibility)
- Change the wall health on submarines/stations back to normal when devs add hull upgrades for pirates
- More station modules for variety
